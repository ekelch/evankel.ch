    <h3>2. evankel.ch (Svelte/TS)</h3>
    <p>This website:
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ekelch/evankel.ch">github/ekelch</a>
    </p>
    <p>This website is currently in development as a playground or showcase of other things I am working on.</p>
    <p>I use React + Angular at work so decided to try Svelte for this. So far I enjoy it the most, but perhaps that is
        only because I am doing this for fun and not for work:) However, it is pretty easy to learn
        and has some nice shorthand syntax for things like props, binding, and reactivity that I enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>Not exactly sure what the end goal is! Just trying to update as I go and think of things.</p>
