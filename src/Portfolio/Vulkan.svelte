    <h3>3. Vulkan API</h3>
    <p>
        I've been spending some time learning Vulkan, a 3D Graphics API. This is used by game engines and other 3D applications
        to utilize hardware like graphics cards and enable accelerated rendering. There are multiple APIs, including Vulkan, OpenGL,
        DirectX, and Metal. I've chosen Vulkan because it is modern, offers great performance, and can be translated
        and cross-compiled to work on most any OS and architecture.
