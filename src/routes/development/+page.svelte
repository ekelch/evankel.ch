    <p class="text-center mt-6">This website is made using Svelte and tailwind. I am mainly focused on learning rust right now though! I'm reading through the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/" class="text-cyan-100">rust book</a> and am completing the <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/series/advent-of-code-2022" class="text-cyan-100"> 2022 advent of code.</a></p>
    <p class="text-center mt-6">I work full time using a Java/Spring Boot for an API and Angular for frontend. I also use AG grid most days :)</p>
    <p class="text-center mt-6">Future plans for this site are serving content from a turso db through a rust api made with axum. None of this is required to send some text but it'll be fun.</p>
    <p class="text-center mt-6">Here's the <a href="https://github.com/ekelch/evankel.ch" class="text-indigo-400"> repo </a>for this website, you won't be impressed!</p>
