    <p>I work at JPMC and use Java/Angular, am moving into a React project soon.</p>

        Since javascript as a whole is kind of icky, this has inspired me to take up learning C.
        I've picked up the C Programming Language book (Kernighan & Ritchie 1988) and am trying
        to complete most of the examples included. I am still in the first half but am enjoying the constraints
        and the strict typing that is not fake. I am also playing with SDL so perhaps in a year or two
        I'll have some garbage game!
